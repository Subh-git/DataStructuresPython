#declaration of tuple
tup = ()
#tuples are immutable so after declration we cant add values in it and neither can we delete it
#tuples are faster than lists and provides readonly access to data

tuple1 = ("Geeks","Jungle", "Abc")
print(tuple1)
tuple2 =(20,)   #for inserting single element
print(type(tuple2))
